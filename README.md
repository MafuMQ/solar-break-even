# Solar Break-Even Calculator

## Project Overview
The Solar Break-Even Calculator is a web application that helps users determine the financial feasibility of installing solar panels. It calculates the break-even point by analyzing initial costs, potential energy savings, and return on investment over time.

## Usage Instructions
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MafuMQ/solar-break-even.git
   cd solar-break-even
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure that you have Python installed (preferably version 3.6 or higher). Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Application**:
   Start the web application by running:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. **Access the App**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the Solar Break-Even Calculator.

## Dependencies
- Flask
- NumPy
- Pandas

Ensure you have these libraries installed by following the **Install Dependencies** section above.

## Example Scenario
Let’s consider a scenario:
- **Initial Cost of Installation**: $20,000
- **Monthly Savings on Energy Bills**: $150
- **Total Annual Savings**: $1,800
- **Expected Lifespan of Solar Panels**: 25 years

**Break-even Analysis**:
- Total Savings Over 25 Years: $45,000
- Break-even Point: 11.1 years (approximately)

In this example, after about 11 years, the initial investment will be recouped through savings, making it a financially viable option for solar energy installation.

## Conclusion
This project aims to give users a clear understanding of the financial implications of investing in solar energy, encouraging a shift towards sustainable energy solutions.
